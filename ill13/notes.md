You and I are the founders of an indie game partnership that specializes in "cozy games". Together, we are building easy pick up and play games for casual players; we aren't concerned with multiplayer or monetization. Our games are meant to be played for 5-20 minutes per session. Just a few steps beyond clicker / idle games. This isn't enterprise level work, this is fun work! 



Please do a deep dive on this code. We have some wonderful features to discuss! Remember this is a cozy sort of pick up and play game that is geared towards 5-20 minute sessions. We aren't trying to build the "greatest trading sim evah!" just a fun, honestly enjoyable, trading puzzle game for casuals to enjoy while waiting in a queue with just enough depth for enoyable replays. We don't want to bog players down with data and decisions. No bullshit, give me the brutal truth, tell me I'm wrong to make sure we have the best game.





We need to implement this, do you have any questions? Remember this is a cozy sort of pick up and play game that is geared towards 5-20 minute sessions. We aren't trying to build the "greatest trading sim evah!" just a fun, honestly enjoyable, trading puzzle game for casuals to enjoy while waiting in a queue with just enough depth for enoyable replays. We don't want to bog players down with data and decisions. We can consider starting with simple calendar quests like Bramble Cottage needs a crystal orb or Ocean Wharf needs to tools for fishing, or whatver ideas you think can work. No code, let's discuss 




That said, I need you to take a good look at our current code base to refresh yourself with the project.

Attached is some WFC demo code we are working on


Modify WaveFunctionCollapse.js:
Modify MapRenderer







Modify GameState.js for WFC Integration
Replace MapRenderer with ParchmentOverlay 
Update Main.js Initialization:

Sounds great! Would you generate code complete drop-in working replacements for GameState.js, Main.js, and MapRenderer.js as sonn as you are ready? Remember, don't overengineer -let's get this running today!




- I've already cut and pasted the MarketActions code into /src/classes/MarketActions.js
- I've removed the text "static " from MarketActions.js
- I've written the import for Main.js "import { MarketActions } from "./classes/MarketActions.js";"
- I've created a constructor "constructor(gameState) {
        this.gameState = gameState;
        this.marketLogic = marketLogic;
    }"
- I added "export" before "class MarketActions"
- I added "const MarketActions = new MarketActions(gameState);" right after "const gameState = new GameState(game);"
- I used find & replace in MarketActions to find " gameState." and replaced all with " this.gameState."
- I used find & replace in MarketActions to find " marketLogic." and replaced all with " this.marketLogic."


- I used the regex "MarketActions\.(\w+)\(" to find and replace with "MarketActions.$1("


MarketActions\.(\w+)\( 

to find and replace with 

marketActions.$1(





Please do a deep dive on this code. We have some features to discuss.



 Would a game designer who's not a programmer benefit from being able to change this value without touching code?







Discuss three professional and architecturally appropriate fixes for "Price calculation inconsistency", no code.



What solution best fits our current architecture and is the easiest to both implement and maintain?



Please walk me through implementing "Temporal Market Recovery System". Create the new function, show me where to add it, and what else to remove / change. Do this step by step.

GameState needs to be the single source of truth. Please walk me through implementing "use GameState correctly". What to remove / change. Do this step by step.



Would you integrate this into our existing project? Don't change any game code, just targeted UI. I believe we do need the existing CSS as a base. And it needs to be a separate file. Also do not integrate the JSON files, we need to maintain that separation.

- Quest item needs to be purchased elsewhere and delivered to the requesting location. Player can't buy the fish at the wharf and redeem at the wharf. Also the items need to be "sold" at the destination to fulfill the quest
- When items are fully purchased and store stock depleted, don't remove the item from the inventory display. It's too confusing and the player is unaware that of what just happened. Just ghost it
- We need a current inventory on the trading screen.
- World map inventory not working either 



- In fact, only the top window should change between the trading and the world map
  


- Each location should only show what it is willing to buy and what it sells, always in the same vertical order





Better! Primary issue is that the marketInsights and back button are no longer visble unless we set the browser to use an extreme vertical length. I think the itemsList needs to be either limited to an amount that always allows for the visibility of those items or something like a fixed navbar on the bottom. Also, the inventory needs to scroll vertically.
